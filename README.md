# Quiz Maker

## Multiple Choice Bank Builder

### About

**Quiz Maker** is a desktop application that allows user to
*create* multiple-choice questions. Users are able to *write*
a set number of answers (3) for each question. Users can also decide whether to *include* correct answer as well.

This application would be most useful for teachers and professors, as they may want to make and store course exams for
students to take. Of course, the application may also be used for non-academic purposes, such as creating quiz for
friends and family to have a fun social time together.

### Inspiration

My main inspiration for this idea comes from Kahoot, a very fun, interactive learning platform where everyone can create
their own quizzes and invite others to play it by typing in an access code. I am also fascinated by the fact that
multiple different tests can be simultaneously created from a question bank to ensure exam fairness. Hence, I want to
try and create an app that can do the very core purpose of creating question banks.
